# Quanitfying homes affected by Texas power outages after severe storms of 2021

In February 2021, the state of Texas went dark when winter storms left millions without power. This repository will use satelite data along with data on buildings and highways in Texas to attempt to quanitfy how many homes in Houston, Texas lost power during these outages. We will then look to see if socioecnomic factors, specifically median income, are predictors of outage areas.

More background information on these stroms and datasets used can be found in the R markdown script that carries out this analysis.

Where is the data?

Due to the size of the data, data will not be stored in this repo. The data will instead be stored locally and included in the gitignore.
